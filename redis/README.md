# Redis
Redis is an in-memory database (a database that keeps the dataset in RAM) which periodically stores data back to disks. This makes Redis ideal as a cache system: the data is structured, its latency is lower and throughput is higher than data stored in disks, while still offers data persistent (compared to Memcache which doesnâ€™t save data to disk by default).

# Installation

`apt-get install redis`

# Redis commands

**MONITOR** is a debugging command that streams back every command processed by the Redis server

`redis-cli monitor`

**FLUSHALL** Delete all the keys of all the existing databases, not just the currently selected one.

`redis-cli flushall`
